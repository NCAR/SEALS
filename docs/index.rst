=====

The SEALS (Source Emission Accounting & Localization System) project is a joint
project between the National Science Foundation (NSF) National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR), managed by the University Corporation for
Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Colorado State University (CSU) and the Planetary
Science Institute (PSI) to create an open-source software tool that uses a
machine learning (ML) approach to locate and quantify methane emissions at
upstream and midstream oil and gas facilities outfitted with low-cost
meteorology and continuous CH4 monitoring instrument platforms.
